# Weather-Dashboard
## Description
This application was created to work on demonstrating and understanding the use of 3rd party APIs. This weather dashboard uses openweathermap to display a 5 day forecast for any city in the United States. The search history is saved per session and is displayed in the search tab for easy access so users can go back and retrieve old forecasts.
